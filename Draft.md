## Magnus Gustafsson - Fullstack web developer

## Shorter

I work as a fullstack web developer at Intergiro Intl AB, in Uppsala. I especially enjoy frontend work. I worked on StochSD, an Open-Source Simulation Software, written in native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without any framework, which gave me a good understanding of how JavaScript, the DOM and CSS work. In addition, I've also tried React and Svelte in side-projects. I'm currently most familiar with StencilJS since that's what I use at my job.

### My Story - longer
After Gymnasium, I studied Computer Graphics Design in Gothenburg for two years at YRGO. While learning Unity, I found how enjoyable it was to code. I then spent much more time than needed seeing what I could code in Unity, to the extent that I neglected the Graphics part of it. Later while working as a 3D-graphics artist at Easy-Laser in Gothenburg, alongside software developers, I saw how engaging and challenging the job seemed. That lead me to start the 5-year Master's Programme in Computer and Information Engineering at Uppsala University. During my education, I worked on the Open-Source Continuous System Simulation Software StochSD, developed with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. After my education, I started at Intergiro Intl AB, in the Uppsala office. I work as a fullstack developer in a small team, on both the backend with Cloudflare Workers and the frontend with StencilJS, all code written using TypeScript. I've now worked there for {calc time}.
